### A bit about me

I am a software developer and a blogger. I love open-source and I am always 
striving to improve and expand on my coding skillset. You can find my portfolio 
website [here](https://ritesh-koushik.vercel.app).

### What I'm hacking on

I am currently focusing on improving my Rust knowledge and expand into Solana. 
Additionally, I am really drawn to CLI tools (esp using Bubbletea in Go). At 
the moment my progress on them in slow going so my personal projects are private.

### My interests
- Backend and distributed systems
- DevOps and Cloud Engineering
- Command Line Tools
- Web3 and Blockchain

### The vibe

Relax, write some code, drink some coffee and enjoy some music.
